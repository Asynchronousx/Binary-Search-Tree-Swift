# Binary-Search-Tree-Swift
An implementation of a BST in Swift 4.1

A Binary Search Tree is a special kind of Binary Tree where each node has at least two children, where the left one is smaller than the parent and the right one is bigger. 

This peculiarity make this kind of tree suited for binary search, insertion and deletion with time complexity of Θ(log(n)) in the average case, and Θ(n) in the worst, making it linear.
